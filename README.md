  JPS Website
</h1>

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Run the website locally**

    You need to create a ``` .env ``` file in the root of your local repo, and add the following contentful keys __CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN__, and __SPACEID__

2.  **Run the website locally**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the minimal starter.

    ```shell
    # install all the dependencies
    npm install
    
    # run the application locally
    npm run start
    ```

## üöÄ Deployment

Deployment for this project is handled by  [AWS Amplify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/index.html), every push to dev will trigger a deployent to [dev](https://dev.johnproctorstylist.co.uk), every push to main will trigger a deployent to [main](https://johnproctorstylist.co.uk). Also webhooks have been setup so any content changes in Contentful will also trigger new deployments for both environments.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Improvements 
  - Align models on Contentful with components within the application, the justification for not doing this was due to the application being very bespoke and not changing often, so I could get away with not using the Content Models in a way that would be considered best practice.

  - Use a consistent approach to styling and reuse more, I just didn't value this enough to go back and fix it as this was a small project with limited time.
